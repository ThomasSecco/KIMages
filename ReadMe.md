# 🎉 KImAge: Exploring Aging Perceptions Through User-Generated Photos 📸

Welcome to the **KImAge Project** – a unique study that dives into the multifaceted perceptions of aging, leveraging the power of computer vision and natural language processing. This project was conducted as part of an internship at **Furtwangen University** 🏫, where I worked as an intern researcher. The study provides insights into age-specific themes through the analysis of user-generated photos and descriptions, offering a comprehensive view of aging across different life stages.


## 🌟 Project Overview

Aging perceptions play a vital role in shaping individual behavior, societal norms, and even public policy. Traditional approaches to studying these perceptions often rely on self-reported questionnaires, which can limit the complexity and authenticity of responses. **KImAge** aims to overcome these limitations by analyzing user-submitted images and accompanying descriptions through advanced machine learning techniques, allowing for a real-time, nuanced understanding of aging.

### 🔑 Key Features
- **🧩 Mixed-Method Framework**: Combines computer vision and natural language processing for a holistic view of aging perceptions.
- **👥 Multi-Age Group Analysis**: Engages diverse age groups to highlight varying perspectives on aging.
- **🔐 Ethical & Inclusive Design**: Prioritizes data privacy, with stringent adherence to ethical guidelines in image collection and processing.

## ⚙️ Methodology

1. **📷 Data Collection**:
   - Participants capture images reflecting their perception of aging and provide descriptions.
   - Images are collected from three age groups: young adults (20-30 years), young-old adults (50-69 years), and old-old adults (70+ years).
2. **🖼️ Image and Text Analysis**:
   - Computer vision techniques identify objects and themes within images.
   - NLP methods process descriptive texts, categorizing sentiments and themes.
3. **🔍 Multi-Label Classification**:
   - The project integrates sentiment and functionality classification, allowing for nuanced data interpretation across emotional and productivity dimensions.


### 🛠️ Technical Overview

- **Image Processing Models**: Uses advanced models like CLIP, Faster R-CNN, and YOLO for image captioning, object detection, and confidence scoring.
- **Semantic Scoring Mechanism**: Employs a custom similarity function to align textual and visual elements accurately, enhancing the depth of analysis.
- **Data Distribution Analysis**: Categorizes data into themes such as physical changes, resilience, and social connections to identify prominent age-specific concerns.

## 📈 Results

The findings reveal that different age groups prioritize distinct aspects of aging:
- **Physical Health and Autonomy**: Key concerns among older adults.
- **Social Connections**: Valued across all age groups, with emphasis on family and friendships.
- **Engagement and Learning**: Younger adults highlight lifelong learning and mental engagement.

## 🚀 Future Work

The project sets the stage for further exploration into:
- Enhanced image and text data augmentation techniques.
- Improved labeling methods for more precise classifications.
- Application of this mixed-method framework to other psychological and social phenomena.
